2)Faculty dashboard:


side panel

~New setup :

we Have to ask sem course and div
and enrolled SPID-s [two option - excel file and SPID enter]
here data will come from student table

e.g.

suppose after entering above details we need to enroll students
and we just enter 1 SPID and that SPID related students details will be added to  that setup and it will visible on that screen in real time add and deletion feature

 after all SPID gets done here we just send final submit to create final changes to database.


~ modify setup:

adding/remove students from AMS setup

only enrolling will be removed nothing else(student details wil be still present in STudent table)

STUDENT ONCE enrolled in AMS database never gets deleted without admin account rights and access. we can make inactive student to not to display his data(usually 9 th or last sem student after they passed out)

~delete setup

deletion of setup we can delete particular setup with confirmation


here in each modul we need to ask for confirmation each and everytime we are doing any major operation like update/delete/submit (final)


~home

here all details of set up will be visible
like google classroom classed faculty will select setup by clicking
and after that view data of enrolled student(for that setup only)-1 st option

2nd option - take attedance for that setup

here we need to give input of RFID reader number and time and date


we can put two screen here 1) temp where all readed ID will come

and 2) enrolled stundets will with checkbox and other details so automatically present students will be marked and removed from temp screen and only absent student will be highlighted in 2nd screen and
 in temp screen extra readed ID will be shown up (like for other semester)

here in 2nd screen we need a lot of formatting like

checkbox majorly / color of present absent 
mark all at once feature absent seperate  present seperate

give extra details(just <details><summary>) about absent one

manually attedance modify 

submit with confirm prompt


3)System Admin


student register/ faculty register
student/faculty modification/update

sem transfer~ whole/ single
