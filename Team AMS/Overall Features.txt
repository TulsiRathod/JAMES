2] Faculty Dashboard 

Features available in side panel :

i] New Setup 
  - Details about sem, course, div and SPID ( two options available i.e. excel file and enter SPID )
    E.g. In a case where students are to enrolled after this step, we just need to enter the SPID and the relevant details will be automatically loaded in the setup further. Finally, we just need to enter all the required SPIDs and ultimately final setup details must be sent to the database.

ii] Modify Setup
  - Add or remove students from the setup as required although only enrollment details could be deleted with student details still remaining intact 
    E.g. Suppose a student in the end semester of final year, the relative details could be updated to inactive status only being stored for the sole purpose of record.

iii] Delete Setup
  - setup can be deleted with due confirmation from the user and also before performing major actions like update, submit or delete.

iv] Home 
  - relevant details of the set up will be visible i.e. setups in google classroom, microsoft teams, etc.
  - Option 1 : Setup can be selected and enrolled students' data can be viewed
  - Option 2 : take attendance for that setup wherein RFID reader number, date and time should be given as input
     (For this option, 2 screens may be presented to the user, first temporary wherein all read IDs are displayed and second wherein a list of enrolled students with their details and checkboxes. By checking these boxes, accordingly the student will be removed from the temporary screen ultimately leaving only absent students at last.)
     Note : Option 2 required a variety of formatting options i.e. checkboxes, color coordinating absent present with green and red, mark all absent or present, summaries of absence and presence, manual modification of attendance, final submission to be done with a confirmation prompt box


3] System admin

Features available :
 - Student registration
 - Faculty registration
 - Student or Faculty modification
